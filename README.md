# Gorg Battle

* A console based application that stimulates Gorg battle for many times. Player is prompted to enter health and shield value for Boov.Then Gorg and Boov's odds of victory is calculated.
* Utilized object oriented concepts (inheritance and polymorphism) to implement a base class Competitor and two derived classes Boov and Gorg to make the program more flexible and robust.
* All objects are created dynamically on the heap. Tested to ensure memory-leak-free using Valgrind.
* A makefile is included. The executable is named "app".
